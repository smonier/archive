# Archive Content - User Guide

Quick reference guide for content editors and managers.

## What is Archive Content?

The Archive feature allows you to safely move outdated or unused content to a secure archive location. Archived content is:

- ✅ Preserved with all metadata intact
- ✅ Organized by date (year/month)
- ✅ Marked as read-only
- ✅ Traceable to its original location

## When to Archive Content

**Good candidates for archiving:**
- Expired news articles or blog posts
- Outdated campaign pages
- Deprecated product information
- Seasonal content after the season ends
- Draft content that's no longer needed

**Do NOT archive:**
- Currently published content (unpublish it first)
- Content that may be needed soon
- Pages with active incoming links
- Legal/compliance documents with retention requirements

2. Browse to the content you want to archive
3. Select the content item

### Step 2: Check Publication Status
